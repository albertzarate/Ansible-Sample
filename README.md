This is a repo for all the assignments we are doing for our Enterprise Software Class.

These are the files required to run a simple Apache2 web server on an AWS EC2 instance.
This assumes the EC2 instance is already created and that you have a .pem key file needed
to log into the instance.

For this to work, make sure to run the setup.sh bash script in the same directory
as playbook.yml, hosts, and ansible.cfg
